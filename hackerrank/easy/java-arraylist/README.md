# Java Arraylist

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Sometimes it's better to use dynamic size arrays. Java's  [Arraylist](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) can provide you this feature. Try to solve this problem using Arraylist.<br>

You are given $n$ lines. In each line there are zero or more integers. You need to answer a few queries where you need to tell the number located in $y^{th}$ position of $x^{th}$ line. <br>

Take your input from System.in.

**Input Format**<br>
The first line has an integer $n$. In each of the next $n$ lines there will be an integer $d$ denoting number of integers on that line and then there will be $d$ space-separated integers. In the next line there will be an integer $q$ denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of two integers $x$ and $y$.

**Constraints**<br>

* $1<=n<=20000$
* $0<=d<=50000$
* $1<=q<=1000$
* $1<=x<=n$

Each number will fit in signed integer.<br>
Total number of integers in $n$ lines will not cross $10^5$.<br>

**Output Format**<br>
In each line, output the number  located in $y^{th}$ position of $x^{th}$ line. If there is no such position, just print "ERROR!"

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Number of lines
        int n = sc.nextInt();

        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>();

        // Store the numbers in each line
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            int d = sc.nextInt();

            ArrayList<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>();

            for (int j = 0; j < d; j++) {
                row.add(sc.nextInt());
            }

            list.add(row);
        }

        // Number of queries
        int q = sc.nextInt();

        // Process queries
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {

            int x = sc.nextInt();
            int y = sc.nextInt();

            try {
                System.out.println(list.get(x - 1).get(y - 1));
            } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
                System.out.println("ERROR!");
            }
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
